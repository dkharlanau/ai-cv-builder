# AI-Ready CV Builder — Free, Open, and Searchable by AI

🧱 Why Not LinkedIn (and All the “Smart” CV Platforms)

“If your profile lives inside a platform, you don’t really own it — you rent your visibility.”

# Against the Subscription Economy of “AI Hiring”

The modern job-tech ecosystem is quietly repeating the same mistake that social media did fifteen years ago.  
It replaces discovery with dependence — now under the marketing slogan of “AI-powered matching.”

Every month, new platforms appear promising *smart resumes*, *AI cover letters*, and *instant job matching*.  
But their economics are identical: you upload your data, pay a subscription, and wait for an algorithm to decide who you are allowed to reach.  

They call it automation; in practice, it is **outsourced visibility**.

## The False Promise of AI-Driven Resumes

Many of these tools advertise that they “build your personal site” or “generate an AI resume page.”  
Behind the interface lies the same architecture of control:

- your data lives on their servers, not yours  
- you lose version control and cannot export full structured data  
- access requires recurring payments  
- the “AI matching” logic is opaque, unverified, and prone to noise  

It sounds intelligent but it works like spam — endless notifications, irrelevant offers, synthetic engagement, no accountability.  
The quality of matching falls because the systems rely on scraped or self-reported data, not on open verified sources.

This is not intelligence; it is algorithmic marketing disguised as AI.

## Why This Approach Fails

1. **No transparency.** You do not know what the algorithm reads or ignores.  
2. **No ownership.** Once uploaded, your resume becomes part of their private dataset.  
3. **No portability.** You cannot move your data elsewhere in structured form.  
4. **No signal quality.** The systems flood both sides — recruiters and candidates — with low-value noise.

The result is a saturated, low-trust environment where genuine professionals are drowned out by template-generated content.  
Recruitment turns into keyword gambling.

## A Different Hypothesis

What if instead of giving our data to subscription platforms,  
we **publish a small, structured, machine-readable CV on our own domain**?  

Openly. Transparently. Without middlemen.

Some data must indeed remain private — salary, contact details, internal project information.  
But **core professional identity** (skills, roles, industries, location, expertise) can safely be made public.  
When formatted correctly, it becomes readable not only for humans but also for AI agents and semantic search engines.

The key is to make the data **structured**, not proprietary.

## Example: An Open Prototype

A working proof of this idea already exists:  
[https://dkharlanau.github.io/](https://dkharlanau.github.io/)

This page is not hosted on a paid “resume builder.”  
It is deployed via **GitHub Pages** — a free, high-trust static hosting environment maintained by one of the most crawled domains on the web.  
The main page is indexed by search engines and visible to AI crawlers, while structured data files (`resume.json`, `resume.yml`, `LLM.txt`) describe the professional identity in precise, reusable form.

No paywalls.  
No hidden scripts.  
No ads.  
Just clean, versioned data that both humans and machines can interpret.

---

## Why GitHub Pages Works

- Free, permanent hosting under a domain with high search authority  
- Full control of every byte — text, metadata, permissions  
- Easy to verify, fork, and reproduce  
- Compatible with Schema.org and JSON-LD standards  
- Instantly crawlable by AI bots and search engines

It turns the act of publishing a CV into a **technical statement**:  
“Here is who I am, and here is how an AI can understand me.”

---

## The Principle of Selective Openness

The goal is not to make everything public.  
It is to decide *what should be open by design* —  
what part of your expertise can safely become part of the public knowledge graph.

Structured openness improves both privacy and precision:  
you share less noise, but in a format that intelligent systems can actually read.  

When done right, even a small JSON file on a trusted domain carries more meaning  
than thousands of unverified profiles scattered across proprietary databases.

---

## A Practical Standard for the AI Web

This approach does not require a startup, a subscription, or an API key.  
It requires only discipline and clarity.  

1. Write your CV in plain language.  
2. Add structured data (`resume.json`, `resume.yml`, `LLM.txt`).  
3. Host it on GitHub Pages.  
4. Let search engines and AI crawlers index it.

That’s it.  
A free, high-trust, AI-discoverable professional identity — under your control.

## Closing Argument

The subscription-based resume economy will collapse under its own inefficiency.  
Millions of identical AI-generated pages will drown in each other’s noise.  
The only reliable way forward is **open structure over closed automation**.

By publishing transparent, well-defined data — not feeding opaque models —  
we help AI systems learn to distinguish real expertise from synthetic spam.

That is the idea behind the prototype at  
**[dkharlanau.github.io](https://dkharlanau.github.io/)** —  
a simple, reproducible pattern for professionals who want to exist  
not inside someone’s algorithm,  
but **inside the open, intelligent web.**
