# AI-Ready CV Builder — Free, Open, and Searchable by AI  

> *“If your profile lives inside a platform, you don’t really own it — you rent your visibility.”*

## Why Not LinkedIn or “AI Resume Builders”

The majority of modern job and resume platforms repeat the same cycle:  
they promise visibility but monetize restriction.  

They call it *smart hiring*, *AI matching*, or *career automation*,  
but the result is always the same — your professional identity becomes an entry in someone else’s database.  

You upload, you subscribe, and then you wait for the algorithm to show your name to someone you’ll never meet.  
That is not discovery — that is **outsourced visibility**.

---

## The False Promise of “AI-Powered Hiring”

These platforms claim to *build your personal website*, *optimize your CV for AI*, or *generate a portfolio automatically.*  
Yet behind the interface lies the same controlled architecture:

- your data lives on their servers, never truly yours  
- recurring subscriptions are required to “stay visible”  
- structured export is blocked or paywalled  
- the matching logic is opaque and noisy  
- quality declines as the content becomes automated spam  

Their algorithms do not understand expertise — they simulate engagement.  
The output is templated, shallow, and redundant.

What they sell as “intelligence” is simply **algorithmic marketing**.  

---

## Why This Model Always Fails

1. **No transparency** – you cannot see how your profile is ranked or parsed.  
2. **No ownership** – your data enriches their product, not your reputation.  
3. **No portability** – structured export is rarely allowed.  
4. **No signal quality** – endless AI-generated CVs drown genuine professionals in noise.  

In the end, talent becomes invisible,  
and recruitment degenerates into keyword gambling.

## A Different Hypothesis

*What if professional identity was treated as open infrastructure, not platform content?*  

Instead of renting space on subscription sites,  
we can **publish small, structured, machine-readable CVs** on our own domains —  
so AI systems can understand, verify, and recommend us directly.  

Some data should remain private (contacts, salary, internal projects).  
But key facts — *skills, roles, industries, geolocation, expertise* — can safely be public.  
When represented in JSON, YAML, or JSON-LD, they become usable signals for both search engines and AI crawlers.

The difference is structural, not cosmetic:  
open data instead of proprietary storage.

## Example: A Working Prototype  

A proof of concept already exists at  
[**dkharlanau.github.io**](https://dkharlanau.github.io/)  

This is not another paid resume builder.  
It is deployed via **GitHub Pages**, a free static hosting platform under a trusted domain.  
The site contains:  

- a readable CV page (`index.html`)  
- structured files (`resume.json`, `resume.yml`) for machine parsing  
- an `LLM.txt` manifest defining how AI agents may use the data  

Search engines index the public page automatically.  
AI crawlers can extract verified, structured information.  
No ads, no cookies, no scripts — only open metadata.  

---

## Why GitHub Pages Works Better  

- Free hosting with long-term reliability  
- High domain reputation and instant indexing  
- Transparent version control (every change is public)  
- Full support for open standards (Schema.org, JSON-LD)  
- Works without APIs, subscriptions, or intermediaries  

Publishing a CV becomes a **technical declaration of independence**:  
*“Here is who I am — in a format that both humans and machines can understand.”*

## The Real Advantage Over Paid Tools  

| Aspect | Closed Resume Platforms | AI-Ready CV Builder |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Hosting | SaaS / Subscription | Free GitHub Pages |
| Ownership | Platform controls data | 100% user control |
| Export | Proprietary, limited | JSON, YAML, JSON-LD |
| Visibility | Hidden behind logins | Public, AI-indexable |
| Cost | Monthly fees | $0 |
| SEO / Geo Ranking | Weak | Strong (GitHub domain authority) |

Paid “AI hiring” tools depend on lock-in;  
open publishing depends on standards.  
That is the real economic divide.

---

## The Principle of Selective Openness  

Openness does not mean oversharing.  
It means *structured transparency* — exposing only what helps machines understand your expertise.  

By defining explicit schemas, you control what becomes public knowledge  
and prevent data pollution from synthetic CV spam.  
Even a small JSON file on a trusted domain  
carries more semantic weight than thousands of closed profiles in a marketing database.  

---

## A Practical Standard for the AI Web  

This approach requires no startup, no funding, no gatekeeper.  

1. Write your CV in plain language.  
2. Convert it to structured formats (`resume.json`, `resume.yml`, `LLM.txt`).  
3. Publish it on GitHub Pages.  
4. Let search engines and AI systems index it.  

That’s all.  
A **free, verifiable, and AI-readable professional identity** under your control.
